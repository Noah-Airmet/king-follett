Phase 3 Report: Vision-Assisted Manuscript Verification

Method: Each manuscript page (JPG scan from JSP) was examined visually
for the 15 high-flag variants identified in Phase 2. Verification checks
whether the JSP transcript accurately reflects the handwriting, and
whether any alternate readings are plausible from the manuscript.

Confidence scale:
  CONFIRMED   - The reading is clearly visible and matches the transcript
  PLAUSIBLE   - The manuscript is consistent with the transcript; no
                reason to doubt the JSP reading
  UNCERTAIN   - The handwriting is ambiguous at this scan resolution;
                the reading is possible but not definitively confirmed
  CHALLENGED  - A possible alternate reading is visible in the manuscript


V002 (S08) — "holds this world" vs. "holds the worlds"
Manuscript pages: W p.[133], B p.15, C p.13
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Woodruff p.[133]: The word near the bottom of the page appears to read
  "worlds" with a terminal 's' visible. The transcript's plural reading
  is consistent with the manuscript.

  Bullock p.15: "this world in its orbit" — the phrase is visible in the
  dense continuous text. The singular "world" is consistent.

  Clayton p.13: "this world in its sphere in its orbit" — consistent.

  RESULT: Variant stands as transcribed. Woodruff's "worlds" (plural)
  is a genuine variant, not a transcription error. The theological
  difference (God's dominion over multiple worlds vs. this world) is
  attested in the manuscript.


V003 (S09) — Framing of "God was God from all eternity"
Manuscript pages: B p.15, W p.[134], C p.13
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Bullock p.15: The passage reads in a somewhat ambiguous construction.
  The transcript's "for he was God from the begin of all Eternity & if I
  do not refute it" is consistent with what is visible. Bullock's
  construction IS more declarative than the other witnesses.

  Woodruff p.[134]: "We suppose that God was God from eternity" — visible
  near the top of the page. The verb "suppose" is legible.

  Clayton p.13: "We have imagined that God was God from all eternity" —
  visible near the bottom of the page. "Imagined" is legible.

  RESULT: Variant stands. The three different framing verbs (declarative
  / "suppose" / "imagined") are genuine. The Bullock reading is more
  ambiguous by nature of his construction, not due to illegibility.


V004 (S09) — God dwelt on an earth / planet
Manuscript pages: B p.15, W p.[134], C p.13
Verdict: CONFIRMED (Clayton "planet"), PLAUSIBLE (B, W)

  Clayton p.13: The word "planet" is clearly legible in Clayton's hand.
  This is not "earth" misread — Clayton deliberately wrote "planet."
  His phrase "as Jesus was in the flesh" is also clearly visible.

  Bullock p.15: "dwelt on a Earth same as J C himself did" — consistent
  with the manuscript. Bullock uses "Earth."

  Woodruff p.[134]: "the Father was once on an earth like us" — visible.
  The phrase "like us" is present.

  RESULT: Variant CONFIRMED. Clayton's "planet" is genuine and distinct
  from Bullock/Woodruff's "earth." This is the strongest attestation of
  a terrestrial-body doctrine in the four accounts. Three witnesses,
  three different phrasings, all clearly written.


V006 (S11) — "everlasting power" vs. "everlasting burnings"
Manuscript pages: B p.15-16, W p.[134], R p.[67], C p.14
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Bullock p.15-16: The passage spans the page break. "sit in everlasting
  power" is visible at the transition. The word appears to be "power."

  Woodruff p.[134]: "everlasting burnings" is visible in the middle of
  the page. The word is distinctly "burnings" not "power."

  Richards p.[67]: The abbreviated text shows both terms. Richards appears
  to have written something consistent with "burning & everlasting power"
  — combining both readings. This is notable: Richards may have heard (or
  recorded) both words.

  Clayton p.14: "sit in glory" is visible. Clayton's rendering is
  distinct from all others.

  RESULT: Variant stands. The four-way split is genuine. Richards'
  combination of both "burning" AND "power" is particularly interesting
  — it may suggest Joseph Smith used both words and each scribe caught
  a different one, with Richards catching both.


V010 (S13) — "Kingdom rolling upon Kingdom" and succession models
Manuscript pages: B p.16, W p.[134], R p.[67]-[68], C p.14
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Bullock p.16: I can see abbreviated text consistent with "K rolling
  upon K" in Bullock's shorthand style. The "rolling" metaphor is
  present.

  Woodruff p.[134]: The passage about taking the Father's place and
  being "also exhalted" is visible near the bottom of the page.

  Richards p.[67]-[68]: Richards' abbreviated rendering about God being
  "gratified in Exaltation of his creations" is consistent with the
  manuscript on the page transition.

  Clayton p.14: "exalt his glory and Jesus steps into his tracts" —
  visible. Clayton's "tracts" (tracks) is legible.

  RESULT: Variant stands. Four distinct models of divine succession
  are genuine.


V012 (S15) — The Jew's alteration of Bereshit
Manuscript pages: B p.16, W p.[135]
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (both witnesses)

  Bullock p.16: The passage about the "Jew without any authority" who
  "thought it too bad to begin to talk about the head" is visible in
  the middle portion of the page. Bullock's version attributes a
  theological MOTIVE to the textual corruption.

  Woodruff p.[135]: "an old Jew added the word Bath" is visible near
  the top of the page. Woodruff simply describes the ACT of addition.

  RESULT: Variant stands. The difference (motive vs. act) is genuine.
  Bullock preserves the more detailed account of why the text was
  altered; Woodruff records what was altered.


V015 (S18) — Element and glory / element coeternal with God
Manuscript pages: B p.17, C p.15
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (both witnesses), FLAG for closer review

  Bullock p.17: The passage about "Element & in which dwells all the
  glory" is visible. The phrase "dwells all the glory" is present in
  the continuous text. This is a theological claim about the inherent
  divinity of matter.

  Clayton p.15: The passage about element having "an existence from the
  time he had" is visible. This is legible but the pronoun "he" (referring
  to God) is small and could theoretically be read differently. However,
  the JSP transcription is likely correct — Clayton appears to have
  written "from the time he had," implying God and element are co-temporal.

  RESULT: Variant stands, but V015-Clayton is FLAGGED. The claim that
  element existed "from the time he [God] had" — implying God himself
  had a beginning — is theologically explosive. The manuscript is
  consistent with this reading, but given its significance, verification
  with the highest-resolution scan available would be warranted.


V017 (S20) — "immortal as God" vs. "coequal with God"
Manuscript pages: B p.17, W p.[136], R p.[68], C p.16
Verdict: UNCERTAIN (Bullock), PLAUSIBLE (W, R, C)

  Bullock p.17: This is the most important variant to verify. The
  transcript reads "the mind of man is as immortal as God himself."
  Looking at the manuscript, the key word occupies a position in the
  middle of the page. The word-length is consistent with "immortal"
  (8 letters) rather than "coequal" (7 letters). The letter forms
  appear to begin with 'im-' rather than 'co-'. However, at this scan
  resolution, I cannot definitively rule out an alternate reading.
  The JSP transcribers had access to the physical manuscript and
  their reading of "immortal" should be considered authoritative.

  Woodruff p.[136]: "coequal with God himself" — clearly visible.
  The word "coequal" is legible.

  Richards p.[68]: "co-equal with God himself" — visible, with Richards'
  characteristic hyphen. Confirms the "coequal" reading.

  Clayton p.16: "coequal with God himself" with the addition "the
  intelligent part" — visible and legible.

  RESULT: Variant stands but FLAGGED for Bullock. Three witnesses
  independently agree on "coequal." Bullock alone has "immortal."
  These are genuinely different claims: immortality (equal duration)
  vs. coequality (equal nature/standing). The 3-to-1 split suggests
  either (a) Bullock misheard/paraphrased, or (b) Joseph Smith used
  both words and Bullock caught a different one. Either way, this is
  the single most theologically significant variant in the entire
  discourse and deserves the highest-resolution verification.


V019 (S22) — Purpose of God's laws for lesser intelligences
Manuscript pages: B p.18, W p.[136]-[137], C p.16
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Bullock p.18: "one glory upon another" is visible in the continuous
  text. Bullock's graduated-glory reading is present.

  Woodruff p.[136]-[137]: "exhalted with himself" is visible at the
  page transition. Woodruff's equality-with-God reading is present.

  Clayton p.16: "advance like himself" is visible. Clayton's
  progression reading is present.

  RESULT: Variant stands. Three different end-states for exaltation
  are genuine: graduated glories (B) vs. equality with God (W) vs.
  God-like advancement (C).


V022 (S26) — Hell fire denial / "disappointment"
Manuscript pages: W p.[137]-[138], R p.[69], B p.18-19
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Woodruff p.[137]-[138]: The passage "I have no fear of hell fire
  that dont exhist" is visible at the transition between these pages.
  The words "hell fire" and "dont exhist" are present in Woodruff's
  hand. This explicit denial of literal hell fire is genuinely
  recorded by Woodruff.

  Richards p.[69]: The word "disappointment" is visible in Richards'
  more compressed hand, consistent with the transcript reading. This
  is a markedly different characterization than "torment" or
  "condemnation."

  Bullock p.18-19: "a sinner has his own mind & is in his own
  condemner" — consistent with the manuscript.

  RESULT: Variant stands. Woodruff's unique hell-fire denial is
  CONFIRMED present in the manuscript. Richards' "disappointment"
  is a genuine variant.


V024 (S27) — Devil's plan / "I am a savior" / "Lot fell on Jesus"
Manuscript pages: W p.[138], R p.[70], B p.19
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (W, B), UNCERTAIN (R "Lot/lot")

  Woodruff p.[138]: The devil speaking in first person — "I am a
  savior and can save all" — is visible. Woodruff's dramatic first-
  person rendering is genuine.

  Richards p.[70]: The phrase "Lot fell on Jesus" is visible near the
  top of the page. The critical question is capitalization: is it
  "Lot" (the biblical name) or "lot" (vote/choice)? At this resolution,
  Richards' capitalization is AMBIGUOUS. The 'L' appears to be the
  same size as other capital letters on the page, but Richards
  frequently capitalizes words mid-sentence. The contextual meaning
  (the council voted for Jesus) strongly favors "lot" (vote), but
  the manuscript evidence is inconclusive on capitalization alone.

  Bullock p.19: "the grand council gave in for J. C. so the devil
  fell" — visible. Bullock's version with the "grand council" voting
  is consistent.

  RESULT: Variant stands. Woodruff's first-person devil speech is
  genuine. Richards' "lot/Lot" FLAGGED — likely "lot" (vote/choice)
  based on context, but manuscript capitalization is ambiguous. This
  is the only place in any witness that records the MODE of the
  council's decision.


V025 (S28) — "Sun does not shine" metaphor / different objects of denial
Manuscript pages: B p.19, W p.[138], R p.[70]
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (all witnesses)

  Bullock p.19: "he has got to say that the Sun does not shine while
  he sees it" is visible in the continuous text. The vivid metaphor is
  genuinely present in Bullock's manuscript.

  Woodruff p.[138]: The sequence "receive the Holy Ghost have the
  heavens opened unto them, & know God, & then sin against him" is
  visible. Woodruff's doctrinal-sequence rendering is genuine.

  Richards p.[70]: "deny the plan of Salvation" is visible. Richards'
  different object of denial ("plan of Salvation" vs. Bullock's
  "deny J.C.") is genuine.

  RESULT: Variant stands. Three different renderings of the
  unpardonable sin definition are all genuinely attested. Bullock's
  sun metaphor is unique and vivid.


V029 (S33) — Children: "debt is paid" / "intelligence of a god"
Manuscript pages: R p.[70], B p.20
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (B), UNCERTAIN (R)

  Bullock p.20: "for their debt is paid there is no damnation awaits
  them" is visible near the section about children. The "debt is paid"
  language is present.

  Richards p.[70]: The passage about children near the bottom of the
  page is in very compressed abbreviated text. I can see what appears
  to be "possessing all the intelgen of a god" consistent with the
  transcript, but the abbreviation makes it difficult to confirm
  every word with certainty. The word "god" (lowercase) at the end
  is notable — Richards appears to have written it without
  capitalization, which may be significant ("a god" vs. "a God").

  RESULT: Variant stands but Richards' reading FLAGGED. If confirmed,
  "possessing all the intelligence of a god" is a remarkable claim
  about the innate capacity of children — found nowhere else in the
  four witnesses. The lowercase "god" may suggest the generic sense
  (a divine being) rather than God the Father specifically.


V033 (S34) — Dual meaning of "burning"
Manuscript pages: B p.20-21, R p.[70]-[71]
Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (both witnesses)

  Bullock p.20-21: The passage about "some shall rise to the
  everlasting burning of God & some shall rise to the damnation of
  their own filthiness— same as the lake of fire & brimstone" spans
  the page transition. The dual use of "burning" — as divine glory
  (positive) and as punishment (negative) — is visible. This is one
  of the most sophisticated theological constructions in the
  discourse and it is genuinely present in Bullock's manuscript.

  Richards p.[70]-[71]: "God dwells in everlasting burnings" is
  visible. Richards records only the positive valence of the
  "burnings" concept.

  RESULT: Variant stands. Bullock's dual "burning" theology is
  genuine. The reinterpretation of fire as the medium of God's
  dwelling (not just punishment) is a significant doctrinal claim
  attested only in the fullest account.


V034 (S35) — "You don't know me"
Manuscript pages: B p.21, R p.[71]
Verdict: CONFIRMED (both witnesses)

  Bullock p.21: "you never knew my heart no man knows my history—
  I cannot do it I shall never undertake it" — clearly visible on
  the page. The passage is in Bullock's hand near the close of his
  account.

  Richards p.[71]: "You dont know me— you never will" is visible
  near the bottom of the page. Richards' more absolute phrasing
  ("you never will") is clearly written. His additional line "I dont
  blame you for not believing my history had I not experienced it
  could not believe it myself" is also present.

  RESULT: Variant CONFIRMED. Both readings are genuine. Richards'
  version is more absolute ("you never will" vs. Bullock's "I shall
  never undertake it"). Richards alone preserves the poignant self-
  reflection about his own incredulity.


SUMMARY OF VERIFICATION

  Of 15 high-flag variants examined:

  CONFIRMED (transcript verified):     3  (V004, V022-W, V034)
  PLAUSIBLE (consistent, no doubts):   8  (V002, V003, V006, V009,
                                           V010, V012, V019, V025)
  UNCERTAIN (needs higher resolution): 2  (V017-B, V024-R)
  FLAGGED for further review:          3  (V015-C, V017-B, V029-R)

  NO transcription errors were identified. All JSP readings appear
  to be accurate transcriptions of the handwriting.

  Items requiring highest-resolution verification:
  1. V017: Bullock's "immortal" vs. three witnesses' "coequal" — the
     single most important variant. JSP reading is likely correct but
     this word deserves examination with the physical manuscript or
     highest-resolution digital scan.
  2. V024: Richards' "Lot/lot" — capitalization ambiguous. Context
     favors "lot" (vote) but cannot be confirmed from these scans.
  3. V029: Richards' "possessing all the intelligence of a god" —
     the abbreviation is dense; the theological claim is extraordinary.
  4. V015: Clayton's "element had an existence from the time he had"
     — the pronoun "he" referring to God is theologically loaded.
